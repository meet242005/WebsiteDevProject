            <h1>History of Football</h1>
            <h2>Ancient China</h2>
            <p class="text">
                The Chinese competitive game cuju (蹴鞠) resembles modern association football (soccer),<br>
                descriptions appear in a military manual dated to the second and third centuries BC.<br>
                It existed during the Han dynasty and possibly the Qin dynasty, in the second and third centuries BC.<br>
                The Japanese version of cuju is kemari.<br>

            <h3>Ancient Greece and Roman</h3>
            <p class="text">
                The Ancient Greeks and Romans are known to have played many ball games, some of which involved the use of the feet.<br>
                The Roman game harpastum is believed to have been adapted from a Greek team game known as "ἐπίσκυρος" (Episkyros) which is mentioned by a Greek playwright,<br>
                Antiphanes (388–311 BC) and later referred to by the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria (c. 150 – c. 215 AD).<br>
                These games appear to have resembled rugby football.<br>

            <h4>Native Americans</h4>
            <p class="text">
                There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games, played by indigenous peoples in many different parts of the world.<br>
                For example, in 1586, men from a ship commanded by an English explorer named John Davis, went ashore to play a form of football with Inuit (Eskimo) people in Greenland.<br>
                There are later accounts of an Inuit game played on ice, called Aqsaqtuk. Each match began with two teams facing each other in parallel lines,<br>
                before attempting to kick the ball through each other team's line and then at a goal.<br>
