            <h2>History of Football</h2>
            <h3 id="china"><b>Ancient China</b></h3>
            <p>
                The Chinese competitive game cuju resembles modern association football (soccer),
                descriptions appear in a military manual dated to the second and third centuries BC.
                It existed during the Han dynasty and possibly the Qin dynasty, in the second and third centuries BC.
                The Japanese version of cuju is kemari  and was developed during the Asuka period.
                This is known to have been played within the Japanese imperial court in Kyoto from about 600 AD. 
                In kemari several people stand in a circle and kick a ball to each other, trying not to let the ball drop to the ground<br>

            <h3 id="greece"><b>Ancient Greece and Roman</b></h3>
            <p> 
                The Ancient Greeks and Romans are known to have played many ball games, some of which involved the use of the feet.
                The Roman game harpastum is believed to have been adapted from a Greek team game known as Episkyros which is mentioned by a Greek playwright,
                Antiphanes (388–311 BC) and later referred to by the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria (c. 150 – c. 215 AD).
                These games appear to have resembled rugby football.<br>

            <h3 id="america"><b>Native Americans</b></h3>
            <p>
                There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games, played by indigenous peoples in many different parts of the world.
                For example, in 1586, men from a ship commanded by an English explorer named John Davis, went ashore to play a form of football with Inuit (Eskimo) people in Greenland.
                There are later accounts of an Inuit game played on ice, called Aqsaqtuk. Each match began with two teams facing each other in parallel lines,
                before attempting to kick the ball through each other team's line and then at a goal.<br>
            </p>
            <h3 id="modernfb"><b>History of Association Football</b></h3>
            <p>
                Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, is rooted in medieval ball games and English public school games.
                The modern game of association football originated with mid-nineteenth century efforts between local football clubs to standardize the 
                varying sets of rules, culminating in formation of The Football Association in London, England in 1863. 
                The rules drafted by the association allowed clubs to play each other without dispute, and specifically banned both handling of the ball 
                (except by goalkeepers) and hacking during open field play. After the fifth meeting of the association a schism emerged between association football 
                and the rules played by the Rugby school, later to be called rugby football. Football has been an Olympic sport ever since the second modern Summer Olympic Games in 1900.<br>
