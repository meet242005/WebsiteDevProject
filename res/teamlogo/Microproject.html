     <h1>Leagues of football.</h1>
     <br>The football league system, also known as the football pyramid,
     is a series of interconnected leagues for men's association football clubs in England, with five teams from Wales, one from Guernsey, one from Jersey and one from the Isle of Man also competing. 
     The system has a hierarchical format with promotion and relegation between leagues at different levels, allowing even the smallest club the theoretical possibility of ultimately rising to the very top of the system. 
     There are more than 140 individual leagues, containing more than 480 divisions.<br>
      
    <h1>Five Best Soccer Leagues in the World.</h1>
    <br>Soccer is a global sport with players from every country and leagues in almost as many.
     With so many leagues to choose from, it can be hard for the average soccer fan to find a few favorites.
     To help you find the best soccer leagues, I have made a list of the five best soccer leagues to follow from around the world.<br>
    
     <h3>1. English Premier League.</h3>
     <img width="175" height="175" src="1.webp" style="float:right;margin:0px 10px" > </img>
     <br>The English Premier League (EPL) is the top tier league in England boasting widely known teams such as Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool, and many other popular teams.
     Some of the world’s best players are playing in the English Premier League.
     A few of my favorite players to watch here include Robin Van Persie, Wayne Rooney, David Silva, Sergio Aguero and, of course, Americans Clint Dempsey and Tim Howard.
     The EPL runs from August through May, providing nearly year-round entertainment. And what great entertainment it is! The matches are usually filled with skill, action, drama, and surprises. By the end of the season, you’ll be sitting on the edge of your seat cheering your team on and hoping for victory.
     The English Premier League is broadcast all over the world. In America, it is aired through NBC Sports<br>
    
     <h3>2. Serie A.</h3>
     <img width="250" height="175" src="2.png" style="float:right;margin:0px 10px"> </img>
     <br>Serie A is the Italian soccer league which contains the best teams in Italy. Inter Milan, Juventus, and AC Milan are a few of the well-known teams in the league.
     The players in this league are some of the finest in the world. A few of the most notable players include Wesley Sneijder, Gianluigi Buffon, Daniele De Rossi, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, as well as American Michael Bradley.
     The Serie A season runs during the same time most other leagues play, including the English Premier League. It begins in September and concludes in May the following year.

     My favorite team when I was growing up was AC Milan. I loved watching them play because of the players on the team, particularly Ricardo Kaka.
     Unfortunately for Serie A, they seem to always have a bit of controversy in the air. They had a big match-fixing scandal in 2006 that is still hanging over the league today. Let’s hope they can clear their problems and just play great soccer<br>
     
     
     <h3>3.Spanish La Liga.</h3>
     <img width="175" height="175" src="3.webp" style="float:right;margin:10px 10px"> </img>
     <br>The Primera División in Spain, but better known as La Liga to English speakers, is the top Spanish football league.
     It has been in existence since the late 1920s and still includes three teams today who have never been knocked out of the league.
     La Liga is best known for two powerhouse teams that in recent years have dominated not only this league but other club tournaments throughout Europe.
     Real Madrid and Barcelona contain arguably the best players in the world in Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi respectively. The 2011–2012 season saw both men break the league record for most goals in a season, but Messi ended up topping Ronaldo’s impressive 46 goals by scoring an incredible 50 goals, the current seasonal league record. 
     Besides these players, each squad is brimming with superstars too many to mention here.
     Barcelona has won the championship in La Liga 25 times. They have won the title for multiple years in a row on a few occasions. However, Real Madrid has won the championship 33 times.<br>
     
     
     <h3>4.Bundesliga.</h3>
     <img width="150" height="150" src="4.webp" style="float:right;margin:10px 10px"> </img>
     <br>The Bundesliga is Germany’s primary soccer league. Although formed relatively recently in 1963, it boasts incredible fan support.
     It saw a record level of fan attendance with an average of over 45,000 fans in each game during the 2011–2012 season.
     The Bundesliga has traditionally been dominated by FC Bayern Munich.
     They have recently won the championship six years in a row.While Bayern Munich is made up of at least 7 German national team players, the Bundesliga includes other world-class players such as Robben, Ribery, Huntelaar, and several American team members.
     The season runs from August through May, following a similar schedule as many other European leagues.
     I enjoy the Bundesliga because of strong players, passionate fans, and packed stadiums. The games tend to be very competitive and exciting, making it one of the best leagues every soccer fan should follow<br>
     
     
     <h3>5. Major League Soccer.</h3>
     <img width="150" height="150" src="5.webp" style="float:right;margin:10px 10px"> </img>
     <br>I know many will be confused or disagree, but as an American, Major League Soccer provides soccer action close at hand. MLS is the top soccer league in America. 
     It was formed about 20 years ago to provide both players and fans professional soccer in the US.
     While the league does not contain the same number of superstars as European leagues, it has included stars like David Beckham, Robbie Kean, Thierry Henry, and many Central American players as well as US National Team members.
     Opposite most European leagues, the MLS season runs during the summer months, stretching from March through November. Some have wondered why the MLS would not follow the example of other leagues, but I believe it provides great summer entertainment while most other soccer leagues are on break.
     In recent years, MLS has seen a rapidly increasing fan base in combination with new, soccer-specific stadiums throughout the country. These stadiums provide an incredible atmosphere during the games and, for any American soccer fan, is a must-visit.<br>
