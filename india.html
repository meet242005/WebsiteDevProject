            <p>Association football is the second most popular sport in India after cricket in terms of players participation. India's current top domestic football league is Indian Super League, formed as an unrecognised professional league with eight teams (now 11) to promote Indian football to the country and world. The league began on 2014 and after third season, it was recognised as the second national football league, running parallel with the I-League, thus leaving India as one of the few countries with two fully recognised football leagues. After fifth season, it has been recognised as the joint top domestic football league in India.</p>
            <h3 id="nationalteam"><b>India National Football Team</b></h3>
            <p>The India National Football Team represents India in international football and is controlled by the All India Football Federation (AIFF). The squad is under the global jurisdiction of FIFA and governed in Asia by the AFC. The AIFF is one of the founding members of the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) and the squad is also a part of the regional federation. The team, which was once considered one of the best teams in Asia, had its golden era during the 1950s and early 1960s. During this period, India won gold at the 1951 and 1962 Asian Games, while finishing fourth at the 1956 Summer Olympics.Thus India became the first Asian nation to reach the semi-final of a FIFA organized major tournament.<br>
            </p>
            <h3 id="superleague"><b>Indian Super League</b></h3>
            <p> The Indian Super League (ISL) is a professional football league, which is one of two co-existing highest level in Indian football system along with the I-League. It is organized by the All India Football Federation and their commercial partners Football Sports Development. Due to sponsorship reason with Hero MotoCorp, it is officially called Hero Indian Super League. The league currently comprises 11 clubs. Each season of the tournament generally runs from November to March. During the league stage of the competition, each club plays against all the other clubs in a round-robin style. At the end of the league stage the team with the most points gets declared the Premiers and presented with a trophy named League Winners' Shield, and the top four clubs qualifies for the play-offs. The season then culminates with the ISL Final to determine the Champions who are presented with the ISL Trophy.<br>
